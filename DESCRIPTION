Description: There is a greater need for statistically methodologies to
    detect differentially abundant proteomic substrates
    (proteins/peptides), as quantitative measurements across multiple
    conditions and biological replicates are increasing using
    high-resolution mass spectrometry.  We propose a hierarchical
    graphical model, which incorporates (1) data acquisition rate to
    explain non-normality in peptide quantity and hidden biases in
    classical test statistics, and (2) ionization efficiency explains
    statistical dependence between fragment ion intensities corresponding
    to a precursor peptide. Then, we propose a nonparametric statistical
    method for testing group mean differences in bottom-up proteomics. It
    estimates covariance matrices between fragment ion intensities to
    accurately estimate their correlation and address statistical
    dependence. A nonparametric shrinkage approach is used to cope with
    small sample sizes and avoid ovefitting, because typical MS
    experiments produce a very low number of replicates (e.g., 3 or 4). In
    addition, we propose a bootstrap approach for accurate hyperparameter
    estimation.
