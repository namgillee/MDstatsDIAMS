Description:
    There is a greater need for statistically methodologies to detect
    differentially abundant proteomic substrates (proteins/peptides), as
    quantitative measurements across multiple conditions and biological
    replicates are increasing using high-resolution mass spectrometry.
    We propose a hierarchical graphical model, which incorporates
    (1) data acquisition rate to explain non-normality in peptide quantity and
    hidden biases in classical test statistics, and (2) ionization efficiency
    explains statistical dependence between fragment ion intensities
    corresponding to a precursor peptide. Then, we propose a nonparametric
    statistical method for testing group mean differences in bottom-up
    proteomics. It estimates covariance matrices between fragment ion
    intensities to accurately estimate their correlation and address statistical
    dependence. A nonparametric shrinkage approach is used to cope with small
    sample sizes and avoid ovefitting, because typical MS experiments produce a
    very low number of replicates (e.g., 3 or 4). In addition, we propose a
    bootstrap approach for accurate hyperparameter estimation.
