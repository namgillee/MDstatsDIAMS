\title{Generate random samples from a mixture of beta distributions}
\usage{
rbetamixture(n, shape1s = 1, shape2s = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of observations}

\item{shape1s, shape2s}{vectors of non-negative parameters of component
beta distributions. Length of each vector is the number of component beta
distributions, where (shape1s(i), shape2s(i)) is the parameter for the
i-th component beta distribution.}
}
\value{
a length-n vector of generated values
}
